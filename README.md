# PuzzleVisionPython
--------------------

The Puzzle Vision Python project integrates a small web server with a serial-monitor to provide access to data 
coming from a Robot Controller attached via a Serial interface. Specifically, this code is meant to run on a
Raspberry Pi that is attached to a AStar32u4 Robot Controller HAT. 

This program will display the data that is sent by the AStar32u4, and allows commands to be sent to the Controller
from a web portal. Finally, it will eventually include the ability to view the images that are being taken by
the Controller for debuggin purposes.
